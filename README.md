# Parkinson's Disease Detection

Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking.
Even though there are lot of other tests to be able to find if the person has the Parkinsons disease or not, to be able to detect it in its early stages still seems to be a challenge. Until a mathematician called Max Little who is a research fellow from MIT found out a better way to find the same with 99% accuracy in a 30 second phone call.

Parkinsons can affect the patient's vocal organs in the similar way it affects limbs and hands so just by monitoring the vocal cords in the larynx (vocal box), we are now able to detect if the person has/is developing Parkinsons or not.

Several ML models has been used in order to predict the accuracy of our model and finally testing is done based on the individual's voice frequency and the ouput is generated
